## 🧠 Core Concepts

Odac is designed to be a powerful, developer-first toolkit that runs as a persistent background service on your server. Here’s how it works:

- **Background Service:** Once started, Odac runs continuously in the background, managing all your configured websites and services. You don't need to manually keep it active.
- **CLI Control:** You interact with and control the Odac server through the `odac` command-line tool. This tool allows you to start, stop, monitor, and manage your applications.
- **Automation:** The primary goal of Odac is to automate common server management tasks, such as SSL certificate renewal, service monitoring, and application deployment, allowing you to focus on development.
