## 📦 Manual Installation (via NPM)

If you prefer to install manually or have issues with the quick install script, you can install Odac directly from NPM.

1.  **Install Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js (v18+) installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Install Odac:** Use npm to install Odac globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g odac
    ```
